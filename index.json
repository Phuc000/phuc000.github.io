We are given a Python source with many obfuscated names, but upon closer inspection we notice that they are all simple encryption method that can be easily decrypted. After renaming the variables a bit we got: import random as RrRrRrrrRrRRrrRRrRRrrRr seed = int('1665663c', 20) RrRrRrrrRrRRrrRRrRRrrRr.seed(seed) flag = bytearray(open('flag.txt', 'rb').read()) key_str = '\\r'r'\\r''r''\\\\r'r'\\\\r\\r'r'r''r''\\\\r'r'r\\r'r'r\\\\r''r'r'r''r''\\\\r'r'\\\\r\\r'r'r''r''\\\\r'r'rr\\r''\\r''r''r\\\\'r'\\r''\\r''r\\\\\\r'r'r\\r''\\rr' key_array = [ b'arRRrrRRrRRrRRrRr', b'aRrRrrRRrRr', b'arRRrrRRrRRrRr', b'arRRrRrRRrRr', b'arRRrRRrRrrRRrRR' b'arRRrrRRrRRRrRRrRr', b'arRRrrRRrRRRrRr', b'arRRrrRRrRRRrRr' b'arRrRrRrRRRrrRrrrR', ] func_plusone = lambda param: bytearray([ele + 1 for ele in param]) func_minusone = lambda param: bytearray([ele - 1 for ele in param]) def func_swap(hex): for id in range(0, len(hex) - 1, 2): hex[id], hex[id + 1] = hex[id + 1], hex[id] for list in range(1, len(hex) - 1, 2): hex[list], hex[list + 1] = hex[list + 1], hex[list] return hex func_list = [func_swap, func_plusone, func_minusone] func_list = [RrRrRrrrRrRRrrRRrRRrrRr.choice(func_list) for arRrrrRRrRRrRRRrRrRrrRr in range(128)] def execute_func(arr, ar): for r in ar: arr = func_list[r](arr) return arr def func_add(arr, ar): ar = int(ar.hex(), 17) for r in arr: ar += int(r, 35) return bytes.fromhex(hex(ar)[2:]) ciphertext = execute_func(flag, key_str.encode()) ciphertext = func_add(key_array, ciphertext) print(ciphertext.hex()) We are also provided with the cipher text from the output.txt ciphertext = 5915f8ba06db0a50aa2f3eee4baef82e70be1a9ac80cb59e5b9cb15a15a7f7246604a5e456ad5324167411480f893f97e3 From the bottom up, we first subtract the cipher text with the keyarray base 35, we get the new ciphertext = 3510160288463215651882012568783508204641122149206037501475580951860016882936528922912211607208113004344284877774206570 But here is the catch, notice that the ciphertext now is the result of integer base 17 conversion, so we need to revert it back to a base 17 bytearray, this is not complicated, but sure is very troublesome, luckily we can threw it in an online decoder so that we can get result instead of decode it manually (a good online decoder can be found here: CyberChef ). And the rest can be decrypt fairly easily. def rev_func_swap(hex): for id in range(1, len(hex) - 1, 2): hex[id], hex[id + 1] = hex[id + 1], hex[id] for list in range(0, len(hex) - 1, 2): hex[list], hex[list + 1] = hex[list + 1], hex[list] return hex rev_func_list = [rev_func_swap, func_minusone, func_plusone] rev_func_list = [RrRrRrrrRrRRrrRRrRRrrRr.choice(rev_func_list) for arRrrrRRrRRrRRRrRrRrrRr in range(128)] def execute_func(arr, ar): for r in ar: arr = rev_func_list[r](arr) return arr cipher_text = 0x486f67686960685561685568552559536660375b3a5d28625353275d676753595c6029275a712858536067602b646167 cipher_text = bytes.fromhex(hex(cipher_text)[2:]) cipher_text = bytearray(cipher_text) print(cipher_text) index_array = [i for i in index_array.encode()] index_array.reverse() flag = execute_func(cipher_text, index_array) print(flag) amateursCTF{4t_l3ast_th15_fl4g_isn7_misspelll3d} ","date":"2024-04-12","objectID":"/amateursctf_2024/:2:0","series":null,"tags":["rev"],"title":"AmateursCTF_2024 Writeups","uri":"/amateursctf_2024/#typo"},{"categories":null,"content":"I’m Phuc000, Computer Science student in Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam.
